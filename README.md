# OneMoreGood 🧦

**Small purchases. Real impact. Proof you can see.**

OneMoreGood is a nonprofit initiative that turns everyday purchases into direct, local help for families in **Santa Terezinha, Paraíba (Brazil)**.  
No middle layers. No vague promises. Just real impact you can follow.

---

## ✨ What is OneMoreGood?

OneMoreGood sells simple products (like socks) and uses the proceeds to support people in a small Brazilian town where the project has **local partners on the ground**.

Every action is:

- **Transparent** – you can see where the help goes
- **Local** – partners are inside the city
- **Direct** – no abstract “global causes”

> Buy one thing. Make one more good happen.

## 🎯 Mission

To make doing good **easy**, **honest**, and **close to home**.

We believe people want to help, but don’t trust systems that feel distant or opaque.  
OneMoreGood exists to fix that.

---

## 🔍 How it works

1. You buy a product from the shop
2. Funds are allocated to a **specific local action**
3. Partners on the ground execute the help
4. We publish **proof** (photos, videos, walkthroughs)

No guessing. No “trust us”.  
You can literally watch the impact.
